          <p>After orbiting computer science for at least 5 years, this avid problem- and puzzle-solver committed to pursuing a career in software development. In my position as Lead Coach and Curriculum Developer at Code Next, I realized that the parts I enjoyed most were teaching programming best practices, helping debug and creating sample projects. It also became clearer to me, while advising high schoolers about how to prepare for a career in tech, that I had never fully pursued a career in tech.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Now I am also an avid Javascript Developer and Machine Learning hobbyist. I enjoy fullstack JS development and being able to see a product completed - back-end to front-end and reinforcing my Python skills by playing around with neural networks and tensorflow. I'm looking for a full-time fullstack software developer position that will allow me to work with data and machine learning or tools that will improve efficiency of services for consumers.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          When I'm not coding, you can most often find me reading, taking dance classes or working on puzzles and logic puzzles.
